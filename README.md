# Privacy Policy

By using our services (Bloony Bot), you agree to our Privacy Policy. If you disagree with any parts of of this Privacy Policy, you do not have permission to use our service. We ([developer][Bloonatics] team) reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time.

We strictly comply with Discord's [Terms of Service][DiscordToS] and [Discord Developer Terms of Service][DiscordDevToS].

## General Data Collection
We collect data from Discord and use them to make the application work, our application does not have access to your personal information such as email address, phone number and passwords. It also cannot join servers or send messages as you.

###### Are you collecting data from me?
Yes, Discord API allows application to obtain global user data such as your Discord generated user ID, username, avatar etc. which are already publicly accessible for everyone. We do not targetedly collect data from anyone, or regularly. If you are in a mutual server of the bot (you can check it on the [bot's profile][Bloony]), we may slightly collect more data from you.

###### Message Content
Some of our features require message content access to function, such as auto response system. We are able to read messages from every channel with `View Channel` and `Read Message History` permissions enabled to the bot. We are aware that preventing the **message content** in your server from being leaked is extremely important and we will not share the data to anyone without your permission (except service provider).

###### Guild Member Data
Our application have to obtain the whole guild member list for some features to work. We understand the sensitive nature of the data and it will only be used internally. We do not share your guild member list to other servers, or even third-party (except service provider).

> Service provider is our bot host, they process our data and keep the bot alive.

## Database Storage
Using a Cloud database is necessary for us to make the application work. We do not store any sensitive data in our database, especially personally identifiable information (we do not have access to it).

All we store are:
- [Discord generated ID][DiscordIdDocs]
- Internally generated data (such as commands ran, restart attempts, or any data that are used internally)
- Data that you have requested the bot to store (commands and text input components), it is required for the bot to function.

We do not store these data:
- Personally identifiable information
- Message content
- Guild member list
- Guild member presence data
- And any data that are irrelevant, or not required for the bot to function.

## Security
We have used the following methods to consolidate the security of our application.
- Multi-factor authentication enabled for bot developer, including Discord account, accounts used for bot hosting and database deployment.
- Using a trusted, legal service provider and database infrastructure.

> Warning: nothing in the internet is absolutely safe. We do not have responsibility for any exceptions or unexpected cases that we are not capable to handle.
